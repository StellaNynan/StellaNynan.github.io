    <h1>CompSoc HackSprint</h1>

    <p> Welcome to the HackSprint! The event will start with a brief explanation of the challenges. The HackSprint will start at 12.30 p.m and will end
  at 3.30 p.m. You will have three hours to complete the sprint- We recommend that you spend one hour on the puzzles and the rest on the final challenge.
  But it is totally up to you how you choose to manage your time! </p>

    <p> Refreshements will be served at 3.30 p.m and you are free to take a break while the judges deliberate. The winners will be announced at 4 p.m </p>

    <p> Below is a break down of the instructions of how to use the files for the puzzles and challenges. You can find all the resources you need in the links found at the bottom</p>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>

      <p> For each of the three puzzles, you will have to write a program* in your desired language and IDE to decode the files. Each time you solve a puzzle you will obtain a password which will be used to unlock one of the files needed for the final challenge. </p>

      <p> The files will either contain a series of numbers or letters. Each folder will contain 2 files; one small file which you can use to test your program and a big file which is the one that you should use to find the password.</p>

      <p> Please note that you will only be able to fully attempt the final challenge once you solve the three puzzles. Currently you are only able to view one of the files for the final challenge- once you solve the puzzles you will be able to unlock the other three files.
